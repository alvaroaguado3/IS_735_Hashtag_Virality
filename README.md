# IS_735_Hashtag_Virality
Project Description: Hashtag Virality and Influencer Agents Social media platforms and communication technologies provide a tremendous tool for spreading awareness and highlight issues that may not be represented in mainstream media. Hashtag activism and hashtag virality are popular examples of this trend. Some of these trends have gained tremendous popularity like  #BlackLivesMatter or #MeToo  But also some other more minor campaigns that also gained popularity like  #IceBucketChallenge and even corporate hashtags like #ShareaCoke  With this project we want to understand how a viral campaign unfolds and evolves, but also what are the main drivers in these campaigns.
